<h1> Introduction to Brush Lettering</h1>
<h2> By Nealy Kehres </h2>

<p> Scroll through the images below for a step-by-step guide to hand lettering the word "Happy" in a trendy, modern calligraphic style with a high-quality brush pen and paper or iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. You'll never buy a greeting card again once you master hand lettering! </p>
<p> While making this webpage, I learned how to use the finicky bootstrap carousel, which improved my overall understanding of bootstrap</p>

<!--Begin Carousel -->

<div id="carouselExampleControls" class="carousel slide container" data-ride="carousel">
  <div class="row">
  <div class="carousel-inner">

  <div class="carousel-item active">
      <img class="d-block w-100" src="images/happyholidays.jpg" alt="happy holidays">
      <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
   <p>After learning how to write "Happy," you'll be ready to write phrases like the one above.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img class="d-block w-100" src="images/h-arrows.jpg" alt="h">
      <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
      <p>The arrows direct you which movement your pen should make. When stroking downward, gradually apply more pressure to your pen. When stroking upward, take off the pressure.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img class="d-block w-100" src="images/a-arrows.jpg" alt="a">
      <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
      <p>Unlike regular cursive, you can take your pen off the paper while brush lettering. Oftentimes, letters require it. Add the two seperate strokes as shown to create a single letter.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img class="d-block w-100" src="images/p-arrows.jpg" alt="p">
      <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
      <p>The unusual loop on top of the "p" gives the word a festive and unique vibe. While making large swooping loops like this, moving your hand quickly and naturally will result in the most desirable look. You can repeat the loop on the second "p" or do a simple down stroke as I did.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img class="d-block w-100" src="images/y-arrows.jpg" alt="y">
            <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
      <p>The "y" also requires a swooping loop. With practice, it will come naturally to you.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  </div>
</div>
  <a class="carousel-control-prev" href="#carouselExampleControls" role="button" data-slide="prev">
    <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
  </a>
  <a class="carousel-control-next" href="#carouselExampleControls" role="button" data-slide="next">
    <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
  </a>
<!-- end carousel-->
